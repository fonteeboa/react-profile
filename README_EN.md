Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio, developed with React! This project was created to serve as a platform to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects in an organized and professional manner. The application includes various sections such as "About Me", "My Work", "My Technical Skills", and "Contact". The main goal is to create a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy communication with potential employers and collaborators.

## Overview
This portfolio is a web application developed with React, aimed at displaying my skills and experiences interactively and visually. It includes detailed sections about my previous projects, my technical skills, and contact information to facilitate communication with potential employers and collaborators.

## Visual Style
This version of the portfolio was created in earthy tones, inspired by the idea of coffee, providing a warm and professional appearance.

## Pilot Version
This is a pilot version of the portfolio, not the official version. We are conducting layout and component tests, but it already serves as a starting point for the development of the final version.

## Access to the Portfolio
You can access the published version of my portfolio on Vercel through the following link:
